Most of the indels loci were polymorphic (71% to 96%), and the genetic variability was similar in all populations. The average observed heterozygosities (HO) and expected heterozygosities (HE) ranged from 0.205 to 0.263 and 0.239 to 0.381, respectively. The coefficients of genetic differentiation ( Gst) for all cumulated populations was 0.125, and the Thai native chickens showed higher Gst (0.088) than Myanmar (0.041) and Laotian (0.024) populations. The pairwise Fst distances ranged from 0.144 to 0.308 among populations. A neighbor-joining (NJ) tree, using Nei's genetic distance, revealed that Thai and Laotian native chicken populations were genetically close, while Myanmar native chickens were distant from the others. The native chickens from these three countries were thought to be descended from three different origins ( K = 3) from STRUCTURE analysis.",International,7,,"Okamoto, S.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,

 3-Bromotyrosine (3-BrY) is a stable product of eosinophil peroxidase and may serve as a marker of eosinophil activation. A gas chromatography/mass spectrometry method to measure 3-BrY concentrations in serum from dogs has recently been established and analytically validated. The aims of this study were to determine the stability of 3-BrY in serum, to determine the association between peripheral eosinophil counts and the presence of an eosinophilic infiltrate in the gastrointestinal tract, and to compare serum 3-BrY concentrations in healthy dogs (n?=?52) and dogs with eosinophilic gastroenteritis (EGE; n?=?27), lymphocytic-plasmacytic enteritis (LPE; n?=?25), exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI; n?=?26), or pancreatitis (n?=?27).
 
 
 
 Results
 
 Serum 3-BrY concentrations were stable for up to 8, 30, and 180 days at 4?C, ?20?C, and ?80?C, respectively. There was no significant association between peripheral eosinophil count and the presence of eosinophils in the GI tissues (P?=?0.1733).

Mature male rusa deer (Rusa timorensis) were divided into two groups: untreated group (n=3) and treated group (n=7). The treated rusa deer were administered with two ml of the GnRH-protein conjugate vaccine (Improvac?; 200 ?g/ml). The vaccine was injected subcutaneously into the treated group three times at four- week intervals (April, May and June) and an additional single dose booster was given after a decrease in GnRH antibody levels was detected (October). Blood testosterone concentrations and GnRH antibody titer were determined before the vaccination. Following that, a series of blood collection and evaluation was done for one year. In addition, we conducted a series of semen collection and evaluation, testicular size measurement and antler development recording in all deer for one year. Our results indicated that the level of GnRH antibody significantly increased (p<0.05) co",International,1,420141.0,รศ.ดร.นิกร ทองทิพย์,คณะสัตวแพทยศาสตร์ บางเขน ภาควิชาเวชศาสตร์คลีนิคสัตว์ใหญ่และสัตว์ป่า,10.0,17.0,ภาควิชาเวชศาสตร์คลีนิคสัตว์ใหญ่และสัตว์ป่า,,,,,,,,ภาควิชาเวชศาสตร์คลีนิคสัตว์ใหญ่และสัตว์ป่า,,,,คณะสัตวแพทยศาสตร์,,,Thai Journal of Veterinary Medicine,Effects of immunization against gonadotropin releasing hormone on reproductive functions in male rusa deer (Rusa timorensis),1,

Melamine was then administered to broiler chickens at an intravenous (i.v.) or oral (p.o.) dosage of 5.5mg/kg of body weight, and plasma samples were collected up to 48h. The concentration of melamine in each plasma sample was analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Melamine was measurable up to 24h after i.v. and p.o. administration. A one-compartment model was developed to describe the toxicokinetics of melamine in broilers. Following i.v. administration, the values for the elimination half-life (t(1/2)), the volume of distribution (V-d), and the clearance (CL) were 4.42 +/- 1.02h, 00.52 +/- 0.18L/kg, and 0.08 +/- 0.01L/h/kg, respectively. The absolute oral bioavailability (F) was 95.63 +/- 3.54%.

To clarify the toxicokinetics, and residues of ZEA and its major metabolites ?-zearalenol (?-ZOL) and ?-zearalenol (?-ZOL) in chickens, ZEA was then administered intravenously (iv) or orally (po) to broiler chickens at a dosage of 1.2 mg/kg body weight. The concentrations of ZEA, ?-ZOL and ?-ZOL in the plasma and various tissues were quantified using LC-MS/MS. The plasma concentrations of ZEA were measurable up to 2 h after iv and po administration, and the concentrations of ?-ZOL and ?-ZOL were detected up to 4 h after both types of administration. A two-compartment model was developed to describe the toxicokinetic of ZEA in broilers. The values of t1/2? and Vd were 1.36 ? 0.29 h and 6.40 ? 0.89 l/kg, respectively. The absolute oral bioavailability was 29.66 ? 5.6%. ZEA, ?-ZOL and ?-ZOL were measurable in the vital organs after po administration.

Radiographic evaluation of the ratio between patellar ligament length and patellar bone length revealed no differences between Pomeranians with bidirectional patellar luxation and healthy stifle joints. Functional rather than anatomic patella alta might be associated with bidirectional patellar luxation in Pomeranians. The surgical outcome of extended proximal trochleoplasty was good-to-excellent in 875% of the stifles and all dogs achieved functional recovery. There was only minimal radiographic progression of osteophyte formation at 48 weeks after surgery. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report on bidirectional patellar luxation in small breed dogs and its successful surgical treatment.",International,1,,"Wangdee, C.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,
