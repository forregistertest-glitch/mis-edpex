 Design Prospective study.
 
 Animals Eight young, healthy German shepherds,
 
 weighing 26.3 ` 3.1 kg (mean ` SD).
 
 Methods Anaesthesia was induced and maintained with sevoflurane. A standard tail-clamp technique was used for MAC determination. Within one anaesthetic period, MAC was first determined during sevoflurane anaesthesia alone (MACB); then during morphine infusion (MACM), (loading dose 0.5 mg kg_x0003_1IM; CRI, 0.2 mg kg_x0003_1 hour_x0003_1) then finally during morphine-tramadol infusion (tramadol load- ing dose 1.5 mg kg_x0003_1IV; CRI, 2.6 mg kg_x0003_1 hour_x0003_1) (MACMT). At each change, periods of 45 minutes were allowed for equilibration. Stated entropy (SE), response entropy (RE), and RE-SE differences were measured five minutes prior to and during tail clamping.

Most of the indels loci were polymorphic (71% to 96%), and the genetic variability was similar in all populations. The average observed heterozygosities (HO) and expected heterozygosities (HE) ranged from 0.205 to 0.263 and 0.239 to 0.381, respectively. The coefficients of genetic differentiation ( Gst) for all cumulated populations was 0.125, and the Thai native chickens showed higher Gst (0.088) than Myanmar (0.041) and Laotian (0.024) populations. The pairwise Fst distances ranged from 0.144 to 0.308 among populations. A neighbor-joining (NJ) tree, using Nei's genetic distance, revealed that Thai and Laotian native chicken populations were genetically close, while Myanmar native chickens were distant from the others.

 3-Bromotyrosine (3-BrY) is a stable product of eosinophil peroxidase and may serve as a marker of eosinophil activation. A gas chromatography/mass spectrometry method to measure 3-BrY concentrations in serum from dogs has recently been established and analytically validated. The aims of this study were to determine the stability of 3-BrY in serum, to determine the association between peripheral eosinophil counts and the presence of an eosinophilic infiltrate in the gastrointestinal tract, and to compare serum 3-BrY concentrations in healthy dogs (n?=?52) and dogs with eosinophilic gastroenteritis (EGE; n?=?27), lymphocytic-plasmacytic enteritis (LPE; n?=?25), exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI; n?=?26), or pancreatitis (n?=?27).
 
 
 
 Results
 
 Serum 3-BrY concentrations were stable for up to 8, 30, and 180 days at 4?C, ?20?C, and ?80?C, respectively. There was no significant association between peripheral eosinophil count and the presence of eosinophils in the GI tissues (P?=?0.1733).

Melamine was then administered to broiler chickens at an intravenous (i.v.) or oral (p.o.) dosage of 5.5mg/kg of body weight, and plasma samples were collected up to 48h. The concentration of melamine in each plasma sample was analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Melamine was measurable up to 24h after i.v. and p.o. administration. A one-compartment model was developed to describe the toxicokinetics of melamine in broilers. Following i.v. administration, the values for the elimination half-life (t(1/2)), the volume of distribution (V-d), and the clearance (CL) were 4.42 +/- 1.02h, 00.52 +/- 0.18L/kg, and 0.08 +/- 0.01L/h/kg, respectively.

 Background
 
 Bats are reservoirs for a diverse range of coronaviruses (CoVs), including those closely
 
 related to human pathogens such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) CoV and
 
 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoV. There are approximately 139 bat species reported to
 
 date in Thailand, of which two are endemic species. Due to the zoonotic potential of CoVs,
 
 standardized surveillance efforts to characterize viral diversity in wildlife are imperative.
 
 Findings
 
 A total of 626 bats from 19 different bat species were individually sampled from 5 provinces
 
 in Eastern Thailand between 2008 and 2013 (84 fecal and 542 rectal swabs). Samples
 
 collected (either fresh feces or rectal swabs) were placed directly into RNA stabilization
 
 reagent, transported on ice within 24 hours and preserved at ?80?C until further analysis.
 
 CoV RNA was detected in 47 specimens (7.6%), from 13 different bat species, using broadly 
 
 eactive consensus PCR primers targeting the RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase gene
